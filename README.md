# ND_ML_Projects
Machine Learning NanoDegree projects repository for submission

To install and run this projects, you may check the `environment_used` folder, where the complete environment based on Python 3.6 is included, with the corresponding installation instructions and commands considering an anaconda installation in windows.

### Prerequisites
As specified by the course instructors, the environment is based on python 3.6.

The full packages list included in the environment can be found in the corresponding `requirements_py36.txt`file on the previously mentioned folder if you prefer to run on your own installation or previously existing environment.

### Installing

In the [environment_used](environment_used) Folder, you can find the exported environment named `py36_ND_ML_Udacity.yml`. As listed on the folder [README](environment_used/README.md), in order to install the environment yo should use the following command:
>`conda env create -f py36_ND_ML_Udacity.yml`

Another alternative to install the environment from the `requirements_py36.txt`file, is as follows:

1. First create, name and activate a virtual environment with python 3.6(In the following [link](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/) you can find the process example.
2. Once you have active your environment proceed to install with the following instruction: 
>`conda install --requirements_py36.txt`
