    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most $\\$50,000$, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than $\\$50,000$. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than $\\$50,000$\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than $\\$50,000$, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Accuracy=\\frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "The Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the corresponding Support Vector Classifiers (SVC) has proven their usefulness in a variety of industrial implementations. From machines fault diagnose [(Weiwu Yan & Huihe Shao, 2003)](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1020004/), to economic company solvency analysis[(Auria & Moro, 2008)](https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1424949) among others.

    "In the case of the solvency analysis describe on Auria's Paper (Auria & Moro, 2008). The SVM implementation is tested against Logistic Regression and Discriminant Analysis, for determinating the solvency of a company. Such analysis allows the financial and crediting compannies to determine the liability and elegibility of the corresponding company for possible credits. The scenario is very similar to ours, with the main difference that in the case of the banking implementation the risk of wrongly classifying a company can led to an incapability of repaying, while in our case the risk is only the rejection of the proposal. \n",

    "SVMs is based on margin maximization between the two data classes. The margin is understood as the distance between the hyperplanes bounding each class, where in the hypothetical perfectly separable case no observation may lie. By maximizing the margin, we search for the classification function that can most safely separate the classes. together with this, some of the advantages of this model as mentioned in the [Scikit documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html) and their relationship with our case are the following:\n",
    "- Effective in high dimensional spaces (given the high number of features, this is a crucial point for our case)\n",
    "- Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples. (However, this advantage is not a problem for our case)\n",
    "- Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient. (Still not criticall as our dataset is actually small, however is good to know for larger training scenarios)\n",

    "The principal limitations on the SVM use comes as the number of features greatly surpasses the number of samples, as it needs to be specially careful on the parameters tunning for such scenarios. Some of the problems of the SVMs as showcased by [svms.org](http://www.svms.org/disadvantages.html) lie on the complexity of the models acquired and the difficulty of parameter tuning given it's great diversity.

In this last case, the author implemennt and analyze the use of AdaBoost as a detector of critical events known as *\"voltage collapse conditions\"*. As presented in the scenario, the collapse conditions aren't dependant of an individual element, but the consequence of multiple changes or variations. The collapsing of the system has among the consequences economic costs, and potential damage to both, the infrastructure and the user. The AdaBoost allows the classification of critical scenarios from the analysis and sub classification of multiple data feeding sources.\n",

On the case of remote sensing, it is gaining more and more importance as the computer vision and imaging gain weight. where the consideration of multiple sensors and the determination of the importance for each case is critical in the optimized response of a data driven system. Such is the case of oil spills following and detection, which can have a major impact in the ecological system if it isn't correctly treated. Another example is the analysis and determination of optimal sensing strategies for self driving vehicles, and even space vehicles. In all this cases the Random Forest allows the developers to determine and find the optimal sensory requirements and arrangement for a correct response of a system based on the learning ensemble algorithm.\n",

This methodology is usually used to construct a predic- tion rule in a supervised learning problem and to as- sess and rank variables with respect to their ability to predict the response.\"* [(Boulesteix, Janitza, Kruppa, & König, 2012)](https://doi.org/10.1002/widm.1072). Random forest can handle thousands of variables of different types with many missing values. [(Nguyen, Wang, & Nguyen, 2013)](https://doi.org/10.4236/jbise.2013.65070). This method is also highly resistant to overfitting [(Belgiu & Drăguţ, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2016.01.011). Random Forests is a multi-class classifier that is resistant to noise, has strong classification capabilities, and if you take into account the complexity of the system, it can be considered **relatively** fast both in training and classification [(Mishina, Murata, Yamauchi, Yamashita, & Fujiyoshi, 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1587/transinf.2014OPP0004)\n",

Another element to consider is that as the dataset increased, the scores improved for the datasets, so it can be further improved as more data is collected.One final element to consider when choosing the Ensemble methods was their resistance to overfitting. Which weighted even higher the consideration of such elements.In conclussion, the selected model to further tune is the AdaBoost.\n",

    "The AdaBoost ensemble method is an algorithm based on boosting the performance of low level (or weak) classifiers. In order to achieve and improve the performance, it trains a series of classifiers, by minimizing the error of each iteration. In each cycle, the classifier makes a division of the elements to minimize the number of missclassifications and record such classifiar. After the classification, the weight of the missclassified elements is increased in proportion to their representativity among the data. After the weigh increase, the model trains once more to generate a new classifier. The number of iterations can be set depending on the testing constraints. The final model is an integration of all the previous classification models, with a weighted importance, to mediate the representativity, so that the importance and determination of each set of constraints weights is determined. This integration is what becomes the predicting final model that is evaluated."

    "The AdaBoost ensemble method is a method based on the assumption that the best answer to an unknown data can be obtained by popular voting. So what it does is i generates a group of classifiers, that separate the data into two areas. However for each voting or classification, it changes and increases the penalty for missclassified elements in the previous classifier. As a consequence each new classifier gets a different \"Expertise\" the equivalent to considering different specializations of the voters. So that the summed effect with the corresponding weighting is what determines how new points are classified. A simil would be the American voting system where the weight (or importance) of certain states gives different values to the final presidential decission.\n",

On the other hand, when compared with the scores from the Naive predictor, we can conclude that there was a significant improvement, which is a significant change for the objective case.Being that the improvement in F score is more than twice as good and, the accuracy is more than three times better when compared with the Naive predictor.

It also depends on the habilities of the worker to implement working tools, it is common to hear about people that had excellent grades but failed in a working environment because a lack of assistance habilities such as teamwork, communication, and thought flexibility.

    "My intuition wasn't even close to the parameters proposed by the model, However, a curious element to this is that all the features selected by the model were continous (we can see this if we analyze the feature description on the **\"Exploring the Data\"** section, so these didn't needed the coding required for the discrete inputs. This characteristics given that there is no data lost, imply that there are a lot more datapoints to the continous features than there are for the dummy features created through the coding. The continuity on the data affect the model optimization, as it varies the distances to the proposed weak classificators margins. This model feature selection, also helps to evaluate the proposed coding strategy followed and understand the impact that it may have in future implementations."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "according to the results displayed on the table above, we can see that when we obtained the scores for the reduced data, the scores were reduced by an amount between .03 and .05, this let us understand that the contribution of all the additional variables does not have such a big impact on the model performance. \n",
